## Introduction

In this repository, you will find resources and code examples to support your learning journey in the R programming language. R is a powerful and widely used language for statistical computing, data analysis, and visualization. Whether you're a beginner or looking to expand your knowledge, this repository will provide you with a solid foundation in R.

## Basics

The "Basics" section covers fundamental concepts in R programming. Here, you will find information about variables, data types, operators, and other essential concepts to get you started.

## Data Structures

The "Data Structures" section dives into different data structures available in R. You will learn about vectors, matrices, data frames, and lists, and how to manipulate and analyze data using these structures.

## Conditionals

In the "Conditionals" section, you will explore how to use conditional statements in R, such as if-else statements and switch statements. You'll learn how to make decisions and control the flow of your program based on specific conditions.

## Loops

The "Loops" section focuses on iteration and repetitive tasks in R. You will learn about different types of loops, including for loops, while loops, and repeat loops, and how to use them effectively in your code.

## User-defined Functions

The "User-defined Functions" section covers the creation and utilization of functions in R. You will learn how to define your own functions to encapsulate reusable code and improve the modularity and efficiency of your programs.
